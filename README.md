# VersionDB

Quick Start
==========

Create a Config.xml file which will contain the Database connection information along with some directory information where the scripts will be kept (relative to the path of Config.xml file). Run the VersionDB.exe from the directory where the Config.xml file is located.

See the sample configuration XML and versioning XMLs to understand the XML structure.
